                    <p class="">
                      I’m a rising freshman at City College whose biggest strength is meticulousness.
                      I enjoy coding because there are multiple ways to 
                      solve one issue and I can demonstrate my creativity 
                      and problem solving skills. My most recent experience 
                      is creating an educational page for American Express, allowing
                      me to learn new skills and experience the pressure of real
                      software developers. This opportunity made me more determined 
                      to pursue a career in computer science and become a front 
                      end web developer.

                    <h2 class="section-heading">My Internship Experience</h2>
                    <p class="">
                    This summer I had the opportunity to intern at Accenture with one of their client’s Shiseido. I really 
                    enjoyed my time at Shiseido because I was given tasks that not only required the coding skills ScriptEd 
                    taught me, they also required me to learn new skills along the way. In addition, everyone on my team 
                    were extremely friendly and made me felt like I was part of them. Therefore, I did not hesitate from 
                    engaging in conversations and asking questions.

                    <h2 class="section-heading">What I Worked On</h2>
                    <p class="">
                     The project that I was working was called VISION 2020, a long term strategy to transform Shiseido 
                     into the most digitally advanced beauty company. In order to do succeed, it requires Customer 
                     Data Hub, Analytics, Strategy and Salesforce Marketing Cloud. Most of my work was focused in 
                     Salesforce Marketing Cloud where I helped build up the IP reputation among the brands. I’ve 
                     developed HTML campaigns for 4 U.S. brands, I’ve managed the imports and exports of customer data, 
                     and I’ve learned how to use SQL and Excel to address ad-hoc data requests.

                    <h2 class="section-heading">Key Takeaways</h2>
                    <p class="">
                    An effective teamwork needs a lot of trust, responsibility, and good communication skills. The 
                    amount of trust and responsibility my manager gave me helped boost my confidence in the work 
                    that I did. Although sometimes several tasks were thrown at me at once, I kept myself organized 
                    by taking notes, asking for clarification, and prioritizing specific tasks. Also, when a task 
                    was new to me, I would always try to absorb as much as possible because I wanted to learn more 
                    about it, so I can get the most of out of the internship.

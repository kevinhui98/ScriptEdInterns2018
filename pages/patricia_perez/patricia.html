                        <p class="paragragh">
                             I am a 17 years old, trying to gain experinece in the 
                        tech industry and exploring what options there are. I am 
                        really interested in creating new tech and working in a fun
                        diverse enviornment yet I want to expand my horizon and see 
                        what else there is in the tech industry and how many different
                        fields use tech for their company and/or products.I was introduced
                        to ScriptEd my second year of highschool and has continued to be 
                        apart of this orginization. It has helped me grow has a coder
                        and has a person. I have learned a lot of professional skills 
                        and programming skills, I wish to continue to learn more although
                        I won't be able to take their classes anymore, I will use what
                        they taught me as a guiding path to my future. 
                        </p>
                        <p class="paragragh">
                            I have recently graduated High School and is planning on attending 
                        Hunter College this fall. My major will be Computer Science and I 
                        am very grateful to have had this experince and the knowlege I do now
                        entering college. i believe it will help me a lot in my future classes
                        and career. I wish to become an Software deveopler. I am unsure of what
                        feild I would like to go in but having oppurtunites like these help with 
                        making decisions in the future. I wish to learn more languages as well 
                        and travel to see how tech influences the world around us that we normally 
                        don't get to see.

                        <p class="paragragh">
                           FTI partners up with some very high class clients and my 
                        team helps build software for those clients needs, usually they're 
                        lawyers working a case. When I first visited my worksite, I was a
                        bit intimidated. the building was so big and there was so many
                        professional people working there, I felt like I was going to mess 
                        up or that I was just not gonna be good enough for this. Then, 
                        arriving at my first day and having to meet everyone again, going 
                        to lunch with them and talking, I felt more comtforable. Everyoe 
                        was really welcoming and nice to me. They helped me getting set up
                        and getting started. After that I realized that I would be okay 
                        working here and I ended up really enjoying it.
                        </p>
                        <p class="paragragh">
                            One of the reasons I felt intimidate was due to the fact that I 
                        felt like I didn't know enough about coding languages. I knew 
                        JavaScript, HTML, and CSS and have learned Bootstrapa and jQuery 
                        but after the first meeting I realized a termed they used a lot
                        wa Angular and I did not know that. So coming in, I had to learn a 
                        some Angular 6 and Angular.JS and I prefer the 6. Working on the prjects 
                        was really fun, to see something I develop on a website that other people
                        are gonna use is a complete feeling. I also really enjoyed how included 
                        they made me feel by adding me to their daily routines, like I would be 
                        the one to tell a joke every Friday. I really appreitiated that.

                        <p class="paragragh">
                            The first project that I worked on is confidential, therefore I can
                        not reveal who the customer is or what the project is meant for. However
                        I can say that the project involved a lot of components to it and 
                        I helped biulding amodule for the dashboard. I had to Angular 6 for this 
                        project but I moslty focus on the styling of it. The purpose of this project
                        was to report a value from the website. An example could be, if the website
                        was keeping track of your chores, my  module would report how many chores
                        you've complete, how many you haven't  started and so on. I had a lot of 
                        help from my mangenger with this project. and it was a great introduction 
                        to the workflow becaus ethey were on a deadline and although the feature I 
                        was working wasn't needed asap, I saw first hand how developer work when 
                        under a lot of pressure from a client.

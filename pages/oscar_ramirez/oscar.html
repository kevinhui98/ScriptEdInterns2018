                    <p class="">
                      I like computers and their functionality so I spend some of my time learning about computer languages but I'm mostly interested in the security of a computer. Throughout time I have practiced cybersecurity and that is my main goal. I've practiced a lot of front end languages but currently I'm working full stack, which is backend and front end. Previously I used to work on psychology which is very interesting to me. Behavior and gesture analysis seemed really cool since with that information you could tell how someone is. Math is my best subject I believe because it's not hard and I'm able to find patterns which makes it easier to do something new in math. I like playing basketball and I'm pretty chill, and friendly of course. I however do enjoy putting hardwork in my tasks and making sure I give it more than my all.

                    <h2 class="section-heading">My Internship Experience</h2>
                    <p class="">
                    Frame.io has been a great working environment and I have been learning so much in so little time. My co-workers are really helpful and always positive and I'm able to relate with some of them. At Frame.io I have been doing a justified amount of work and I feel comfotable doing my work or sometimes even when I make a mistake I feel comfortable admitting it and asking for help since everyone is friendly. Lunch at Frame.io is really cool because you get free lunch in the office and in the comfort of your seat or if you would like to go out to eat there are a variety of places to eat, so many that I don't know some of them. I usually prefer to stay in and eat since I can just sit immediately after getting my food and relax. The new languages and things that I learned seemed complex, but with the help of my intern manager I was able to complete my tasks with the least amount of stress as possible. The commute to Frame.io is not so long since it's near 14 St. Union Square and there is a nice park( Madison Park ) I can go to if I need a bit of nature. My interhsip has been my best summer experience.

                    <h2 class="section-heading">What I Worked On</h2>
                    <p class="">I have been working on the support tool which is mainily used by the support team and it has functions to help users of Frame.io. I have been using Semantic UI, Git, Terminal, Elixir, and Phoenix. One of my best works I would say is when I moved the links to the side of a table because it took me quite a while to figure out how I'm gonna style it and my change was shown on every page of the support tool. Some changes I made to the support tool are, links so I can conneect it to another application, of which being Stripe, restyled tables for a cleaner view and more legibility, and adding an icon to the tab so it can look cool. These changes exercised what I learned every day and it put my skills to best practice. What I found cool learning was the terminal and git since they directly talk to the computer or for git, control everything in related to your project. I felt strong working in Semantic UI since it was kind of like Bootstrap but I was kind of able to do more and the syntax was similar. </p>

                    <h2 class="section-heading">Key Takeaways</h2>
                    <p class=""> Some key takeaways from my job are that perseverance is necesary when working because failure always happens, but failure is the way we learn. I made many mistakes when working but the cool thing about it is that I learned a lot upon being able to fix it. Also I have to stay positive about what I do because lacking positivity is reflected in my code. The more positivity, the more effort in my code, the better my work becomes. Something very important that I learned is to always ask questions when necesary because all the questions that I asked my intern manager are the reason I progressed so much and with my progres I showed I learned a lot. Throughout this internship I realized that it is vital to have a good relationship with your coworkers because with that you can guarantee you will enjoy your time in the office and my time at the office was amazing. Be positive, stay positve, and keep on coding.</p>

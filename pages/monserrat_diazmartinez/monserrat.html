            <p class="section-text">
              I am an incoming freshman at the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania. This has been my dream school since 10th grade when I decided I wanted to go into business so I am excited to attend. 
              I want to concentrate in marketing and minor in computer science, something I didn't intially think I would want to do. It wasn't until I got introduced to coding through ScriptEd
              that I got to see how fun coding can be once you get past the frustrating bits. 
            </p>
            <p class="section-text">
              Apart from academics, I love listening to music and especially love concerts, I've only been to 5 but each have been such an amazing and unqiue experience that I find myself jumping at the chance for another one. 
              I also enjoy spedning my time reading, I recently completed the Harry Potter series and I don't know why it took me so long to pick the first one up because they have become some of my favorites. 
              One other thing I love to do is bake, my favorites are chocolate cake, flan, and cheesecake but I would love to learn how to make a souffl&eacute; and tiramisu.

            <p class="section-text">
              This summer I interned at the Vaan Group, they are a company that does design and engineering of websites, mostly ecommerce, for various clients to optimize user experience. 
            </p>
            <p class="section-text">  
              My internship experience was fun. There were only two other workers in the office for most of the time since everyone else was working remotely, so I didn't get the
              typical big office experience like others might have but I still really enjoyed it for my first work experience. 
            </p>
            <p class="section-text">
              I got to see a variety of aspects of a business; I attended client meetings and saw how to give presentations on designs and how important it is to
              give options, I saw what UX research is like for redesigning an e-commerce website and what kinds of feedback is used to better the site, I got a glimpse of what creating a new product brand is like and got to hear about different experiences&mdash;and
              recieve advice&mdash;that my coworkers had.

            <h2 class="section-heading">Key Takeaways</h2>
            <p class="section-text">
              There's a lot that I'm going to take away from this internship. I learned how many details are taken into account when working on a project. You need to have very clear communication with clients in order to give them what they want,
              and even then it could take several revisions before they are content. On that note, it's also important to give your opinion and stand your ground. You shouldn't have to lose your sanity just to please the client.
            </p>  
            <p>  
              Another thing I learned was how many means there are to the same end. If you've already done something, or if someone else has done something, there's no need to remake the wheel; just pull out that old piece
              of work or download that plugin and tailor it to what you need instead of starting from scratch each time. 
            </p> 
            <p> 
              One last thing I learned is how easy it is to reach out to someone on the team for help. While it may have
              seemed intimidating to me at first, I quickly saw that even if you've never met, coworkers are available that have much more experience and therefore knowledge than you and I should take advantage of that. 
              I also saw how valuable anyone can be to a project; when I went to meetings I was able to contribute and my opinions were actually respected and encouraged.

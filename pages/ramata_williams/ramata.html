                    <p class="">
                      I am a rising freshman at Fordham University, and I will be double 
                      majoring in biochemistry and philosophy. This summer I had the privilege of interning at
                      American Express. Last summer I had the opportunity of interning at Oscar Health, and 
                      I met a ton of people there, some of whom I still talk to quite frequently. 
                      Please explore my page to learn more about my experience!

                    <h2 class="section-heading">My Internship Experience</h2>
                    <p class="">
                      Interning at American Express has taught me that there are more important things than
                      everyone liking or favoring you; your work and the things you contribute to the team
                      speak more about your value.
                      <hr/> 
                      Although I didn't feel 100% included in the American Express culture, I do feel as if my work 
                      will continue to assist software engineers at American Express. My co-intern and I struggled with 
                      being the youngest people on the team, and not having much in common with them. However, having to
                      go through that difficulty made us closer, and I left American Express with a new friend and a new 
                      outlook.
                      <hr/>
                      A lesson from my manager that I will always carry with me is that my disadvantages (ie, my inexperience,
                      age, etc) can be assets and valuable to my team. It allows me to look at things from a fresh 
                      perspective, and it also provides the team with an outsider's perspective.
                      <hr/>
                      To summarize, my time at American Express forced me to understand that I don't always have to go
                      into a situation knowing everything, I just have to leave knowing something.

                    <h2 class="section-heading">What I Worked On</h2>
                    <p class="">
                    My co-intern, Ashley, and I worked on implementing a React application called Storybook into the American
                    Express software engineering community, starting with our particular team, Team 6. It's an application
                    that allows you to render and see your UI components without needing to commit, push, or serve them through
                    any particular app your company requires you to.
                    <hr/>  
                    Over the course of five weeks, Ashley and I added all of the components used within a certain sector of
                    the software engineering community at American Express, 'axp-base.' We also had to move our Storybook to
                    the 'test' folder to allow our React Jest and Enzyme integrations to access tests used by our team's components.
                    <hr/>
                    Though it wasn't necessarily easy, I had a blast learning and familiarizing myself with new technologies, and
                    different ways to compose an app from the ground up.
                    <hr/>
                    </p>
                </div>
            </div>
            <div class="row">
                <div class="col-lg-12">
                    <h2 class="section-heading">Key Takeaways</h2>
                    <p class="">
                      1. Though it sounds cliche, I think it's highly important to have fun, and to remember that we are all quite 
                      young, and that we are not expected to be super serious, unsmiling people. Remember that our internships are 
                      only for five weeks, and it's imperative that we make the most of it.
                      <hr>
                      2. Learn! Was an internship really a success if a student left with nothing more than a few more contacts? Always
                      ask clarifying questions, and even if you don't need to remmeber everything that your manager mentions, you should 
                      still have some sort of idea what they are talking about.
                      <hr/>
                      3. Storybook is an amazing, innovative application, and I truly believe that every software engineering company
                      should use it. It's not only beneficial to companies that just desire an easier way  to develop their UI components 
                      and apps, but also to companies that are transitioning to using React company-wide, not unlike American Express.

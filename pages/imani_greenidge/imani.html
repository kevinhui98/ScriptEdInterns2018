                            Imani Greenidge, aspiring software developer and entrepreneur, is a graduate of Brooklyn High School for Law and Technology and Freshman at New York City College of Technology. Born and raised in Brooklyn, NY. He has been regarded by many to be very intellectual
                            and capable of doing whatever he sets his mind to. He has always approached life with this mentality and set big goals for himself. He is willing to work to achieve his goals and gain the success he is in search for.

                        <p class="about flow-text">
                            I interned at Policygenius this summer. Policygenius is a startup that created a website where you can get insurance quotes through their online application. They started 4 years and have seen great success in these past 4 years. Their company is made
                            up of many different teams, and I was on the engineering team this summer.

                            <h3 class="heading z-depth-5">My Internship Experience</h3>
                            <p class="experience flow-text"> I was given several projects or tickets to work on and submitted several pull requests. I was mentored by John Colella who was very helpful and steered me in the right direction for every ticket I was given. I felt like I was
                                making an actual contributions on a website that alot of people visit and use.
                            </p>
                            <p class="experience flow-text">
                                They also showed alot of interest in me and always asked me questions about what I want to do in the future, what my plans are after the internship, how my high school experience was. About halfway through the internship Policygenius moved to a new office
                                space. In this space everyone in the company was all on one floor as opposed to two like in the other office space.

                            <h3 class="heading z-depth-5">What I Worked On</h3>
                        </a>
                        <p class="work flow-text">I worked on modularizing some of the CSS classes which gives classes more specific names. I worked on making checkbox options bold when selected. I worked on a page loader for the basic information page. While the content of the
                            actual page loads the user sees a loading page in which I made based of a design one of the designers made. I also worked on making a sticky when viewed on a mobile device.
                        </p>
                        <p class="work flow-text">
                            I used alot of React, HTML and CSS to make both the page loader and the sticky header. For the sticky header I had to make the React component from scratch and I had to figure alot of it out on my own through trial and error. It was a good learning experience
                            for me to better grasp the concept of React. For both the loader and the sticky header there were designs made that I had to code. It was cool to see that I was able to recreate the design almost exactly.

                        <h3 class="heading z-depth-5">Key Takeaways</h3>
                        <p class="takeaways flow-text">Some of the key takeaways I had from this internship experience was, how to code more efficently, using less code to do that same thing. I feel this is something I struggled with prior to the internship and now I feel much stronger
                            in that area. Learning more ways to create responsive designs without using a library. I felt like I relied to heavily on using libraries like Bootstrap or MaterializeCSS to make my websites responsive, now I learned how to
                            effectively use media queries and FlexBox to do so.
                        </p>
                        <p class="takeaways">
                            CSS Modules to make class names more unique and specific. At this first this concept was a little confusing to me, not realizing how limited you could be with having multiple of the same class names in a big application like the Policygenius website,
                            but once I started adding the modules to the class names it made sense on how they were applied and how they made every class name unique. How to make and use components in React. I feel like React is one of my weaker programming
                            languaes that I've worked with recently, probably due to my lack of practice with it, but I got alot of practice with it during my time at Policygenius this summer. Creating components from scratch and applying them helped
                            me to understand the purpose of React alot more.

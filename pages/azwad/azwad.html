              <h2 class="section-heading">About Me</h2>
              <p class="">
                I am 16 year old high school student living in New York City. Currently aspiring to become a software developer 
                by studying and trying to become a better coder with the support of ScriptEd. 
                I'm also very hardworking, trustworthy and I always do my best to accomplish my tasks. 
                Especially when I to complete projects I try to go overboard because I want to impress others.
                I believe my greatest joy was being praised for a hard job's work being done well.
                My first internship will be at HSBC and I am very excited about working with them and developing my skills as a developer.
                Beside coding and developing, I also enjoy playing sports and playing video games on steam and playstation 4.                   I'm usually found with my friends or colleagues either competing and trying to have fun. 
                Even though I like to compete, I am very relaxed and very easy to aproach.

              <h2 class="section-heading">My Internship Experience</h2>
              <p class="">
                My first ever experience at an internship was at HSBC. 
                Before the internship I had to prepare myself to be mature and well dressed for the occasion                  I was very excited while nervous aswell for the oppertunity to intern at an international corporation.
                My experience at HSBC was very exciting and a totally new experience since im working with professionals
                in their field of expertise. I was able to communicate with their projects give them feedback and help them 
                fix or bugtest for errors. I even joined in one of the calls that was international, from the US to Canada to
                London to Mexico to other countries HSBC has offices in.

              <h2 class="section-heading">What I Worked On</h2>
                <p class="">
                  At HSBC I worked with many great people with a vast knowledge of different tools. The tool I used the most was 
                  Oracle SQL Developer because it was the more accessible and easy to add connections. I also used JIRA tool used
                  ontop of the Agile framework and scrum methodology for DevOps because it is HSBC's new efficient buisness methodology
                  moving away frm the waterfall method. I worked on two projects,REGW(Regulation W) and FRDM(Finance Regulatory Data Model)
                  that HSBC has had for years and made improvements andhelped other developers with features by giving feedback.

              <h2 class="section-heading">Key Takeaways</h2>
              <p class="">
              The key takeways of my internship at HSBC are watching the world cup with other employees that pationately
              cheer on their team and assisting with live projects. I remember when my team just started staring at the TV,
              even one of the managers started watching the world cup despite it being work hours. Also the community is
              very nice and easy to approach when they're not busy. One other key takeaway was going out for lunch with
              my team was great.

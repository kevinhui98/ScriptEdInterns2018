                    <p class="">
                         I am an alumnus of the High School Of Fashion Industries. 
                     In our school we have three majors- fashion, business, and 
                     Graphic illustration or Art. I am an Art majored student and 
                     I really love to paint and craft. By Fall of 2018, I will be 
                     attending CUNY Hunter College. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                         I started attending ScriptEd during my junior year of high school 
                     with the foundations class afterschool. We learned HTML, CSS and a 
                     little Javascript. In the summer, I continued to take part in ScriptEd 
                     summer academy. I also took an advanced class at MLB. I am really 
                     thankful of the opportunity provided to us by ScriptEd and helping me
                     acquire new skills.

                    <p class="">
                      My overall experience at RTR (Rent the Runway) was great and 
                      I loved it. Before, I am always afraid to think about pursuing 
                      a career in the Technical field. I thought computer programming 
                      will be a boring job where you sit in front of the computer all 
                      day long, tying codes and basically, you are married to your computer.
                      I was thinking maybe I should be an artist, I would rather do something 
                      artsy every day then ruining my eyes in front of the computer.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                         But after coming to RTR, it is as if I had a different pair of 
                      lens looking at the industry. RTR made me see that computer programming 
                      can be very accomplished when you made something that everyone will like 
                      and use. It feels accomplishing when everything is going right and the bugs 
                      are fixed. During my internship, there was not one time that I felt bored. 
                      I remember Kiara (my internship partner) asking why do we have so much free 
                      food, drinks and even days like a scavenger hunt and company beach day? 
                      I really liked the answer that was provided which is you have to make 
                      your employees happy. I really saw that everyone in this company really 
                      enjoyed their job and get the greatest out of their job.

                <div class="col-lg-12">
                    <h2 class="section-heading">What I Worked On</h2>
                    <p class="">
                        Over the course of my internship, we learned two main languages used 
                      in this company which is React and Ruby. On our first few weeks of the 
                      internship, we worked in codecademy tutorials to learn about both
                      languages. Meanwhile, we also started on our first ticket of the company,
                      which was to show the warning message longer when something is removed
                      so that the customer service agents are aware that the item is removed.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Our second ticket was basically styling a page. We fixed the spaces and 
                        made sure that the page was clear and everything was easy to find. We added 
                        the pagination function to the page and made sure that each section had about
                        5 transaction orders. We even renamed all of the sections because some might 
                        not know what all the abbreviations mean like RFF, PO, and etc.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Our last ticket was the Kustomer Contact page. We worked with the template 
                        provided by Kustomer and stylized and added the things that were needed in 
                        the wireframe.

                    <h2 class="section-heading">Key Takeaways</h2>
                    <p class="">
                        I really had a fun experience at RTR. The key takeaway from this internship 
                        was that I was able to experience what it feels like to be on a team of software engineers.
                        I was also able to obtain new skills, like new coding languages and problem-solving skills.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I also had a lot of fun during company events like Scavenger Hunt and Beach day. During 
                        these events I was able to know more about RTR, the team and meet new people in the company. 
                        I am also amazed when I visited the DFC because I was able to see how the clothes were packed, washed,
                        and sent. But most importantly, we shadowed some customer service agents and we were able to see how 
                        they are using the things that we built.
                    </p>

          <p class="">
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm a senior at Urban Assembly Gateway School for Technology. My internship is at Slice, a pizza app company. I love video games and surfing the internet. I'll occasionally make a variety of media for fun. I even own a pet cat.<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the future, I want to create video games in my own artistic vision. Making various things like art and dialogue helps me develop my ideas. It makes me feel giddy inside thinking what it would be like if my ideas became real games. Even though I know it isn't easy, I'll make sure be ready to support myself until I can figure out what I want from video game development.

          <h2 class="section-heading">My Internship Experience</h2>
          <p class="">
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While working on Slice's website, I've experienced many problems with items overlapping other items on there website especially with the navigation bar. It was very puzzling figuring out where the problem was and what caused them to overlap. I also got to update the about page of their website by removing parts that offered career opportunities on it. They were going to to create a careers page for that very purpose.<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There were dogs I also got to see when employees brought them to work. Then, I got to play Super Smash Bros 4 with people during lunch. Apparently, I was great enough at the game to beat them at least two times. Being able to eat pizza every week was also great to have at the company.

          <h2 class="section-heading">What I Worked On</h2>
          <p class="">
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During my advanced class, I've made websites and added it to my portfolio. A simple one I finished translated english to pig latin. Another one allows you to play rock, paper, scissors with a computer. Other classmates even worked with me to make a website that forecasts the weather. More websites I've made can be found on my portfolio.<br> 
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now at my internship, I've worked on adding new logos and quotes to Slice's home page. Then, updating their website's navigation bar was the next task. There were also specific changes to other pages. Some were minor like changing the text. Others were major like splitting pages in to two different pages.

          <h2 class="section-heading">Key Takeaways</h2>
          <p class="">
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even in a casual workplace, always ask if you're allowed to do something. In work communities, going to a new one means you have to see what the limits of your actions. Once you learn that, you could just start work as soon as possible if you had an idea on what you wanted to work on. If not use a messager or go to someone so that you can speak to someone if they have work for you.<br> 
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Find other people than your manager to ask for help from. Your manager isn't always going to be available. Plus, getting to know each other means it becomes less awkward to work together since they are just strangers. None of you would know how you act normally so they could act normally in turn. A comfortable talk with each other can keep things focused.

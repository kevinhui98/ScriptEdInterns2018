                    <p class="">
                      Entering the second year of college at City College of New York. 
                      Currently pursueing computer science as my major. 
                      I have exprierence in front-end coding HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and some back-end coding React.js, Node.js, a touch of express.js.
                      I wouldn't say that I know everything but I am a diligent person. 
                      And I would try to find a way to learn and to make up for what I lack.
                    </p>
                    <p class="">
                      As for personal interests I would like to say I'm a simple fan boy I enjoy watching the TV show

                      I'm also interested in animes most of the popular ones at least.

                    <h2 class="section-heading">My Internship Experience</h2>
                    <p class="">
                    Although I was super nervous on the my first day working at MediaMath at World Trade Center I felt like I was ready, I woke up early get ready and wore business casual to dress to impress. When I got there I did achieve my goal but a little to much I was wearing too formal everyone was relaxed with their T-shirts, shorts, and sandals, I was sticking out too much. Sticking out is an interesting change since I was used to wearing business casual during my internship.
                    </p>
                    <p>There were free snacks and and soda everyday and breakfast every Friday. Everyone was outstandingly nice. Before Mark and I got started working we encounter an misunderstanding on how we were going to get paid, although I wouldn’t mind the double pay I would also like to avoid any potential problems during our stay. For a casual business, MediaMath did have some strict security for accessing their information to start working on the project. And everyone was amazingly friendly.

                    <h2 class="section-heading">What I Worked On</h2>
                    <p class="">
                      The project we were focusing on during the internship was  strived to learn ExpressJS. Mostly it was difficult for me because I was not use to working on the back-end. But the struggle was worth it. The project is a bulk forecaster. It’s basically a wait for forecaster how this campaign will sell in the future. We  also took account of the different devices the campaign is using with, different locations people can be looking at the campaign, and the different markets the campaign is registered. Also instead of just one forecaster we were able to get multiple forecasters. And within different devices, locations, markets and the bid price the forecaster will be different.

                    <h2 class="section-heading">Key Takeaways</h2>
                    <p class="">
                      Some key takeaways that I can’t say about working at MediaMath is first I would love it if my future company will be just as great as MediaMath. The people there are friendly and even challenge you in ping pong to relax. The location of the office is also amazing it is also within walking distance from where I live. Although the location is in the financial district which makes everything have a higher price I believe it is not as pricey as for example 42st and we have employee discount for working around the neighborhood.
                    </p>
                    <p>The company is located in 4 world trade center which allow you to see the historical landmark (Ex Twin Tower). I have visited the site before and seen it but not through a birds eye view. My manager (Adam) is a great guy, although he’s always busy he finds some ways to catch up with us and make sure our brains aren’t totally fried.

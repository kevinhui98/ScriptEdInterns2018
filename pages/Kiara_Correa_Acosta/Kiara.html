                    <p class="text">
                        My name is Kiara Correa Acosta. I am 17 years old. I graduated from All City Leadership Secondary School and I am attending Smith College in the Fall of 2018. I am currently undecided but am heading towards doing a double major in computer science and
                        early childhood education. Some of my favorite things to do are read, listen to music, and do facemask on my free time.
                        <br><br> I started coding in my Junior year of Highschool with ScriptEd, from this foundations course I went on to do the ScriptEd Summer Academy. During this time I had the chance to work with a mock client. This led to me take
                        more interest in the world of web designing. I processed to be a part of the advanced course that ScriptEd offered at a tech company. I was placed at Oscar Health for the year. Lastly, I am an intern on the CX Tools Team at Rent
                        the Runway. </p>

                    <h2 class="section-heading">My Internship Experience</h2>
                    <p class="text">
                        While my time at Rent the Runway I experience a lot. From the start, I was allowed to set meetings and attend events. Some meeting I made was with marketing and social media director, college reps, current software engineers. This opportunity gave me
                        the knowledge on how to manage my time while being productive with my time. <br> Some non-tech experiences that I have had the pleasure to be a part of are the Company Scavenger Hunt and the Company’s Beach
                        Day. My team actually won the Scavenger Hunt and I met a group of people that I hadn’t really had interactions with till this event. Due to us winning, we were given the opportunity to have a team lunch. During this time I talked
                        to this group of people about things related to work but also about random things like vacations. <br> Lastly, my internship goal by the end was to make the most of this opportunity. I think that this was completed the moment in
                        which I had a conversation with Jennifer Hyman, the co-founder, and CEO of Rent the Runway. </p>

                    <h2 class="section-heading">What I Worked On</h2>
                    <p class="text">
                        My time at Rent the Runway, I have worked on codecademy on learning React and Ruby. Learning two new languages, Ruby and React was a bit time consuming but I still managed to work on the projects given. <br> I paired with current
                        engineers to work on tickets to help dismiss certain bugs that have been reported by the CX admins. When at the DFC we were given the chance to shadow CX agents and see them using the programs we were fixing bugs too. In addition
                        to these tickets for bugs, I have helped in styling certain pages for the clarity of CX admin users. Lastly, we were working on replicating a webpage for a contact us page to mock the wireframe that was given to us. </p>

                    <h2 class="section-heading">Key Takeaways</h2>
                    <p class="text">
                        “If you're not going to speak up, how will the world supposed to know you exist” <br> I took this quote to heart when being at Rent the Runway. As a 17-year software engineer intern, I knew that I would not really be noticed unless
                        I put myself out there. Personally, I am usually shy around people I barely know but I made sure that I was going to step out of my bubble. I did this by setting up meetings on my own, going to company events and talks, asking
                        questions, filling out forms and applications.<br> I even presented at Drinks and Demos when it was not required. Not only did I have to speak to put myself out there but I also know that if you do not ask for help on something
                        you are stuck on, nothing will get done at the end. Another key takeaway I encountered was that everyone at the company was really opened to helping me in any way possible. Whether that be in pairing to teach me something new or
                        even to talk about their experiences. </p>
